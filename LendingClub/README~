LendUp Data Challenge

=== Introduction ===
The project (a) visulizes feature distribution of the training set; (b) builds a classification model to predict if a loan will be end up begin fully paid with a high degree of confidence; (c) downloads the Data Challenge dataset and randomly select records.

=== Usage ===

-------------
Question #1
-------------

Q1.py
 
* Dependences: stats_feature.py, cross_feature.py

* Description: 
  (a) Histogram visualization of the distribution of a feature; 
  (b) Statistics
      - Numertical feature: mean, stadard deviation, NaN counts 
      - Categorical feature: ratio by class, Nan counts
  (c) Histogram view of the normalized ratio between 'Fully Paid' and 'Charged Off' for a feature

* Usage: (a) ./Q1.py 
         (b) python Q1.py
         (c) run Q1.py (in ipython)  

-------------
Question #2
-------------

Q2.py
* Dependences: preprocess_data.py, learning.py, vis_model.py

* Description: 
  (a) Separate the dataset to training based on loan_status:
      Training set: Fully Paid, Charged Off
      Test set:     Default, In Grace Period, Late
  (b) Build a classifer using a set of selected features
  (c) Prediction of customers who will be in 'Fully Paid' saved in 'prediction.csv'
  (d) Plot feature importance and ratio of fully paid by current loan status

* Usage: (a) ./Q2.py 
         (b) python Q2.py
         (c) run Q2.py (in ipython)      

-------------
Question #3
-------------

Q3.py
* Dependences: none

* Description:
  (a) Download dataset
  (b) Randomly select 1000 records and save to 'random.csv'
  (c) Print number of lines in 'random.csv' by stdout

* Usage: ./Q3.py
